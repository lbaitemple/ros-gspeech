gspeech

ROS package for speech recognition based on Google Speech API



NOTE: This package does not work now, seems that Google changed their APIs/policies or authentication  methods

UPD: Fixed, now working with API v2, you need an API Key from  Google Developer Console

+ PyAudio (>= 0.2.7)
+ flac
